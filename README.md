# TouchSynth - Android Screen Surface Instrument
# Please treat this project as the product of a few initial experiment.
# My current synth based projects involve using CSound and C++ so this
#one was left as it was when I switched to these systems. If you build
#it in Eclipse it should be fun to download and try out.
# Tested on LG Nexus 5 and Samsung S2.
